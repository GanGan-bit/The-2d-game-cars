Greetings to all GitHub users. I've made something of a skeleton on this branch so far. I'm going to make a game in which there will be levels, police chases, car upgrades, as well as locations, dialogues, and the plot will also be present in the game. I hope you will take part in my project, I will be very grateful for your help. You can also take the game for yourself, I will try to explain all the difficulties in the code clearly, but most importantly, I will do it in 2 languages (also, if someone knows other languages, you will greatly help beginners to easily enter the IT sphere)

If something is not clear to you, then write to me in Telegram, I will try to tell you in simple words and with a bunch of examples for your project.
